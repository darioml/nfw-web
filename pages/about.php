    <h3>New Financial Worlds Conference</h3>
    <p>
    The New Financial Worlds Conference is an annual exclusive event dedicated
    to a particular topic of interest in the financial world. The event attracts people from a wide
    range of both academic and professional backgrounds. The conference aims to
    identify new trends in the evolution of the financial world, thus providing
    a broad understanding of the mechanisms associated with certain markets and
    asset classes.

    </p>
    <p>
  The first conference, held in March 2011, brought together over 200 participants at the Bloomberg HQ in London. Following this success, we received over 450 applications for our second conference held in March 2012. All participants underwent a rigorous selection process in order to ensure the day was spent amongst the highest calibre of people with a similar mind-set. It was an extremely successful event where attendees had the opportunity to network with a range of top level industry experts, as well as attend exciting panel discussions and interactive workshops. Notable guests included executives from leading investment banks along with internationally recognised academics and leading market specialists. The speakers were devoted to delivering thoroughly enjoyable and informative presentations of the highest quality on a variety of topics.

    <h3>New Financial Worlds Conference | Derivatives</h3>
    <p>
    The theme of this year's conference is Derivatives. Due to a substantial
    increase in such portfolios in recent times, we wish to provide our audience
    with a greater understanding of the product and the more complex issues
    surrounding them. We aim to achieve this through a range of presentations
    dedicated towards Derivative products, their mechanisms of use and their
    implications within the markets. </p>
<p>
We wish to particularly discuss credit valuation adjustment (CVA), counterparty
credit risk and risk management. Counterparty credit risk is crucial when
determining the fair value of any derivative portfolio. In past years, it was
common to mark derivative portfolios to market without considering the
counterparty risk associated. However, as a consequence of a number of high
profile defaults in 2008, there has been a growing interest towards CVA as this
can be considered as the difference between risk-free portfolio and true
portfolio values, taking into account the risk of default. Ultimately, CVA is an
important tool, as essentially it is the monetized value of the counterparty
credit risk.
<BR><BR>
This year's conference will be held on 10th March.
